This is the project of Poker game on web using stack MERN but typscript (i don't know which one better but it makes me learn typscript)

the final output will be the game can be played multiplayer on browser or single player using bot, and the user will have an account, or maybe there will be a guest system for someone who doesn't want to play it with an account and just trying, and i want to apply chat gpt or any AI to be bot, so the player will be playing againts adavnced AI instead just regular bot.

in this project i learn tech Stacks for full-stack web and learning new algorithm for playing poker, making bots or AI, and connectiong bot to AI.

i wish this project can run smoothly as this will be my first portofolio that can be accessed by many.

Thanks for coming!
